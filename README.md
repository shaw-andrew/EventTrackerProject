# EventTrackerProject
## Desctiption
This project is a multi-week RESTful project. I created an exercise tracker database in SQL. For the time being it only tracks run distance, but through the week and over next weekend I intend to change things up and add another couple of tables. I think the first table should be users, there should be a transactional table for session, then a workout table so people can populate their session and different users can track multiple workout.

So far I've worked on the back-end creating a Java program that talks to SQL and tested my current endpoints using Postman.
